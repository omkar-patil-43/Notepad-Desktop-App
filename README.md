### Notepad Application Presentation

#### Introduction:
Hello, and thank you for having me today. I'm excited to present a Java-based text editor application that mirrors the functionality of a classic Notepad. This application is a testament to various Java programming concepts and design principles.

#### Key Features:

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - Developed using Java Swing, the GUI provides a user-friendly environment for text editing.

2. **Event Handling:**
   - Utilizes the `ActionListener` interface to respond to user interactions, ensuring a seamless experience.

3. **File Operations:**
   - Supports fundamental file operations such as opening, saving, and printing files using Java I/O classes (`FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedWriter`).

4. **File Chooser:**
   - Implements the `JFileChooser` for file selection, restricting file types to `.txt`, `.html`, `.css`, and `.java` extensions.

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Enhances user efficiency with keyboard shortcuts for New (Ctrl + N), Open (Ctrl + O), Save (Ctrl + S), and more.

6. **Text Manipulation:**
   - Allows users to copy (Ctrl + C), paste (Ctrl + P), cut (Ctrl + X), and select all (Ctrl + A) with ease.

7. **Exception Handling:**
   - Demonstrates robust error handling for file-related operations, ensuring a reliable application.

8. **Object-Oriented Approach:**
   - Adheres to OOP principles, encapsulating functionality within the `Notepad` class and potentially using additional classes (e.g., `About`) for related features.

9. **Layout Management:**
   - Utilizes the `BorderLayout` for effective organization of components within the main frame.

10. **Multithreading:**
    - The application runs on the main thread, following best practices for Swing applications.

11. **UI Customization:**
    - Offers user customization with features like font selection, line wrap, and word wrap.

#### Conclusion:

In summary, this text editor application showcases the versatility of Java programming, encompassing GUI development, event handling, file I/O, keyboard shortcuts, and object-oriented design. It provides a robust and user-friendly platform for basic text editing needs. I am open to any questions or discussions you may have regarding this project.

Thank you for your time.
